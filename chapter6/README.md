### Use of Pointers

> Arrays are implemented using pointers. Pointers can be used to iterate through an array (as an alternative to array indices)

> They are the only way you can dynamically allocate memory in C++ (covered in lesson 6.9). This is by far the most common use case for pointers.

>  They can be used to pass a large amount of data to a function in a way that doesnâ€™t involve copying the data, which is inefficient

> They can be used to pass a function as a parameter to another function

>  They can be used to achieve polymorphism when dealing with inheritance

> They can be used to have one struct/class point at another struct/class, to form a chain. This is useful in some more advanced data structures, such as linked lists and trees.

### Conclusion

> Pointr is variable that hold a memeroy address. use `*` can help dereferenced the origin value.
